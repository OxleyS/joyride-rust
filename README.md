# Joyride

A racing game that pays heavy homage to retro psuedo-3D racing games such as Super Hang-On. Originally built in C++ and SDL (but not released on Github), this project is a rewrite using Rust and Bevy instead.

- To run locally: `cargo run --features dev`
- To build and locally serve a web build: `cargo make serve`
    - Must have previously run `cargo install cargo-make`
